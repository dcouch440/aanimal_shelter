For windows users navigate to the database.yml file to set your username and password.

```
Setup postgresql for rails

	üìÅ config > üìë database.yml
        default: &default
          adapter: postgresql ‚úîÔ∏è
          encoding: unicode
          pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
          username: (username here) ‚úîÔ∏è
          password: (password here) ‚úîÔ∏è

```
* If you wish to keep these private you can also use a credentials password or an ENV file

* Note : we use <%= %> inside the database file because we are not within a ruby file.

### `Credentials`
* See this link to learn how to do so. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHgvPPr2nLE )

* Start off by deleting your credentials.yml.enc file and master.key (within config folder) in order to generate another

```
  For vs code users try (within the terminal)
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

* Within the file add then close the file to save

```
  pg_database_username: add username here
  pg_database_password: add password here
```

* Then inside the database.yml (see description above) add (or uncomment)

```
  username: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_username %>
  password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_password %>
```

* Thats all for credentials

### `ENV`
* start by adding the gem
```
gem 'dotenv-rails'
```

* add a .env file to your main directory

```
touch .env
```

* within your file add your key and value (no quotes)

```
FIRST_VALUE_NAME='FIRST_VALUE'
SECOND_VALUE_NAME='SECOND_VALUE'
```

* Then from within your files you can call on these files as such

```
  username: <%= ENV['PG_USERNAME'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['PG_PASSWORD'] %>
```

* Thats all for .env files

* Within the main directory of the project create your databases with

```
rails db:create
```

```
rails db:migrate
```

* From here to start the server you will need to type in:

```
  rails s
```

* visit localhost:3000 to view the app
